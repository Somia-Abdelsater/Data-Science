## Overview

Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that applies statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data. This repository contains several of my data science projects, each focusing on different aspects of the data science workflow, such as data exploration, feature engineering, machine learning, and model evaluation.

The projects here are designed to be both educational and practical, offering hands-on solutions and examples that you can adapt for your own work. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, these projects will help you build a deeper understanding of the tools and techniques used in the industry.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several directories, each containing a different data science project:

- **Data_Preprocessing/**: Projects focused on cleaning and transforming raw data into usable formats, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature extraction.
- **Exploratory_Data_Analysis/**: Projects that involve exploring datasets through visualization and summary statistics to understand trends, patterns, and relationships.
- **Machine_Learning/**: Projects that apply machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering to solve problems and make predictions.
- **Deep_Learning/**: Projects using neural networks and deep learning techniques like CNNs and RNNs for complex tasks such as image classification and natural language processing.
- **Model_Evaluation/**: Projects that demonstrate how to evaluate model performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and techniques like cross-validation.
- **Time_Series_Analysis/**: Projects that focus on time-based data, including forecasting models like ARIMA and LSTM networks.
- **Natural_Language_Processing/**: Projects that work with text data, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.

Each project folder includes Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and dataset files, along with detailed comments explaining the methods used.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Science.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Project Folder**:
   - Browse to the folder corresponding to the project you're interested in.

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Each project may have its own dependencies. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   - Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) file and run the code. Follow the instructions and comments in the notebook to execute the analysis or model.

## Usage

Each project folder contains detailed instructions and code with comments to help you understand the process. Here's an example of how to use a machine learning project:

### Example: Machine Learning - Predicting House Prices

1. Navigate to the `Data-Science/House price` folder.
2. Open the `Predicting house prices.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow these steps in the notebook:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, scale features).
   - Train a machine learning model ( Linear Regression).
   - Evaluate the model's performance.
